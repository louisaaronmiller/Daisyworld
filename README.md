# Daisyworld

Further study on Daisyworld that couldn't be added into the main report included: Albedo variations, and measuring the dependence Albedo values have on Daisyworld.
Attached to this github there is a document named "additional_daisy" detailing three 3D graphs of varying black and white albedos with black, white, and total populations.
